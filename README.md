# Subterra
Subterra is a fantasy role-playing game based on the source code for [Blackstone](https://github.com/Blackstone-SS13/BLACKSTONE), and is inspired by Table Top Role-Playing Games.
The goal of Subterra is to provide a free-form fantasy role-play environment with minimal admin intervention, where players are empowered to collectively decide what is and is not acceptable through in-game action.
